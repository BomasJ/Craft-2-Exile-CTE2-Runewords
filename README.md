This is a chatgpt project, has alot of issues like code that doesnt need to be in there, but it works.
- **input-output.py** reads .intput.txt and outputs to .output.txt. You can input the current runes you have, and equipment you want to rune, and it will spit out possible runes.
+ **list.py** allows you to type in the weapon type (sword/axe/etc), returning all runewords.
- If Craft 2 Exile has an update the new runewords can be found in `C:\Users\t\AppData\Roaming\PrismLauncher\instances\Craft to Exile 2-0.8.4b\minecraft\config\openloader\data\CtE_MNS\data\mmorpg\mmorpg_runeword`
